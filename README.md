The file Wang_Hall_Kim_Code.ipynb contains the code that my group used to simulate a variable-length pendulum. It contains a function for solving the system's equation of motion as well as representative plots of the pendulum angle, its time derivative, and state space. Wang_Hall_Kim_Code.ipynb can be run using Jupyter Notebook. The file Wang_Hall_Kim_Report.pdf describes our system, derives its equation of motion in dimensionless form, and explores its behavior as several parameters are varied.
